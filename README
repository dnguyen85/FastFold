Automatic folds (that is, folds generated by a fold method other
than `manual`), bog down VIM noticeably in insert mode and are often
recomputed too early (for example, when inserting an opening fold marker
whose closing counterpart is yet missing.)

See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Keep_folds_closed_while_inserting_text
for a discussion.

With this plug-in, the folds in the currently edited buffer are updated by an
automatic fold method only

- when saving the buffer, or
- when closing or opening folds (off by default), or
- when typing `zuz` in normal mode

and are kept as is otherwise (by keeping the fold method set to `manual`).

Each of these triggers for updating folds can be disabled by adding

- `let g:fastfold_savehook = 0`, or
- `let g:fastfold_togglehook = 0` (default value), or
- `let g:fastfold_map = 0`

to your `.vimrc` file.
